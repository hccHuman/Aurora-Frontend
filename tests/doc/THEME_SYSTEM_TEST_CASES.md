# Theme System (Light/Dark Mode) - Test Cases & Documentation

## Overview

The theme system provides users with light and dark mode switching capabilities. The implementation uses:

- **Tailwind CSS** with dark mode support
- **localStorage** for persistent theme preference
- **View Transition API** for smooth animated theme switching
- **System preference detection** (prefers-color-scheme media query)
- **Responsive animations** that adapt to device capabilities

---

## Architecture

### Components

1. **ThemeToggle.tsx** (Wrapper)
   - Entry point for theme functionality
   - Handles SSR safety (no hydration mismatch)
   - Initializes theme on mount
   - Delegates UI to AnimatedThemeToggler

2. **AnimatedThemeToggler.tsx** (UI & Logic)
   - Renders toggle button with Sun/Moon icons
   - Handles theme switching with View Transition animation
   - Implements smart duration calculation based on device capabilities
   - Updates localStorage and DOM classList

3. **tailwind.config.js**
   - Enables dark mode with `class` strategy
   - Defines dark mode color schemes

### Storage & State

- **localStorage key**: `"theme"`
- **Values**: `"light"` or `"dark"`
- **CSS Class**: `.dark` on `<html>` element
- **Fallback**: System color scheme (prefers-color-scheme)

---

## Test Cases

### ✅ TC-1: Initial Load - Light Mode (Default)

## Test Execution Environment

### Browser DevTools Setup

```javascript
// In Console - Verify theme state
document.documentElement.classList.contains("dark"); // true/false
localStorage.getItem("theme"); // "dark" or "light"

// Verify View Transition API support
document.startViewTransition; // function (Chrome/Edge)

// Simulate network throttling
// DevTools → Network tab → Slow 3G / Slow 4G
```

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **View Transition API** - Only supported in Chrome/Edge 111+
   - Fallback: Instant theme change without animation

2. **Multi-tab Sync** - localStorage doesn't auto-sync across tabs
   - Workaround: Listen to `storage` event for sync

3. **SSR** - Theme applied after hydration may cause flicker
   - Mitigation: Inline script in `<head>` to apply theme early

4. **prefers-reduced-motion** - Current implementation may not fully respect
   - Status: Should be enhanced to skip animation when preference set

---

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add `storage` event listener for cross-tab synchronization
- [ ] Implement inline theme script in HTML head for zero FOUC
- [ ] Add support for `prefers-reduced-motion`
- [ ] Add theme transition config for customization
- [ ] Support for theme preview before applying
- [ ] Analytics for theme preference distribution
